The JSE fell sharply on Tuesday morning, posting broad-based losses, despite a stable rand. Global markets were digesting heavy selling of tech shares on Monday, when the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 3%. Concerns over iPhone demand and fears that chipmakers would be caught up in the US–China trade war weighed heavily on demand, said London Capital Group analysts. Focus this week is expected to be on any Brexit developments, as well as the Reserve Bank interest rate decision on Thursday. The outcome of the decision is by no means certain, pointing to possible volatility on the local market. At 9.45am the all share was down 1.21% to 51,790.6 points and the top 40 had lost 1.3%. Banks fell 1.44%, industrials 1.42%, and food and drug retailers 1.34%. Naspers fell 2.47% to R2,755.29, tracking losses of Hong Kong associate Tencent.
