Nesi Chetty from Momentum chose Dipula Income Fund A as his stock pick of the day. Chetty said Dipula is a diversified company with a property portfolio. “We like the retail assets within the company and they seem to have a good management team that will try to extract good value. Their A unit is probably lower on the risk spectrum where you will get distribution growth of around 5%.”
