Nick Kunze from Sanlam Private Wealth chose Sasol as his stock pick of the day. “It is certainly a play on the oil price, which sold off on 8% on Friday and is down 20% in the month. If we are seeing a little bit of the emerging market rand weakness coming through, there might be a proper oil price we should get a kicker out of Sasol.”
