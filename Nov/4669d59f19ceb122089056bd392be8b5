Viv Govender from Rand Swiss chose Euro Stoxx 50 Capital Protector as his stock pick of the day. He said: “There is an expectation for the markets to do well after the US midterm elections as shown in previous years, however, we are still in a 10-year bull market and the correction is bound to happen at some time. If the market goes up, you will get a digital return of 55% with a 40% down side protection, and it’s all in US dollars.”
