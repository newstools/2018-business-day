The JSE opened slightly up on Tuesday as markets reacted with subdued trade to the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore. Some analysts welcomed the Korean leader’s commitment to the "complete denuclearisation" of the country’s nuclear arms arsenal. Others said what Trump had done was to elevate a rogue leader, shunned by most of the world, to the level of a world statesman. TreasuryOne analyst Andre Botha said the focus in markets was still on the central bank meetings on Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will announce an expected rate hike of 25 basis points. The European Central Bank (ECB) could announce a winding-down of its stimulus policies later in 2018. "With some confusion in the market, we have seen emerging-market currencies bearing the brunt of the uncertainty," he said. Central banks in India and Turkey tightened policy as the prospect of US Fed tightening and protectionism intensify emerging-market pressure, Barclays Research analysts said.
