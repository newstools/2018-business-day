German investor Aton suffered a defeat against other Murray & Roberts (M&R) shareholders on Tuesday, with a motion to proceed with a merger with Aveng winning the vote. Aveng’s share price jumped 37.5% to 22c on the news, while M&R’s share price fell 2.36% to R17.38. Aton issued a statement following the vote saying it “believes that the outcome of the vote was heavily influenced by a major conflict of interest by a large shareholder base in M&R”. “Those shareholders, who are at the same time Aveng bond-and shareholders, are seeking to protect their interest in Aveng,” it said. Aton said the deal that other shareholders had voted in favour of “is a U-turn in M&R’s stated strategy, is highly value destructive, will negatively impact M&R’s financial performance and situation, and has no benefits for shareholders of M&R”. Aton concluded by saying: “With the above in mind, and having heard the entirely unconvincing arguments presented by M&R, Aton remains unequivocally against the proposed transaction, which will destroy shareholder value and impose significant and unpredictable risk to M&R.” The takeover regulation panel still needs to independently determine whether M&R can proceed in exploring the potential transaction with Aveng.
