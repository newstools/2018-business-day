1. Quarterly employment statistics What it is: an establishment-based survey of whether jobs were added or lost in various industries in the private sector, and in government. What it is not: unlike the quarterly labour force survey, the QES does not provide demographic information Expectations: • FNB expects a drop from the fourth quarter of 2018, when seasonal hiring usually accounts for an increase in jobs. • Investec says more investment is needed to stoke job creation. 2. Producer inflation: Inflation as measured by the producer price index is due on Thursday. Expectations: • Investec expects producer inflation to have slowed in May, forecasting a 4.2% year-on-year increase in the PPI, from 4.4% in April. • FNB expects it to be unchanged. 3. Private sector credit figures, due on Friday: Growth in private sector credit extension slowed to 5.1% in April. Both FNB and Investec expect an uptick to 5.4% for May. 4. Trade balance: The South African Revenue Service announces balance of trade figures on Friday. Expectations: The trade surplus narrowed sharply in April, but the news is expected to be better in May. • A Reuters/Bloomberg consensus, cited by Trading Economics, puts it at a R3bn surplus. • Trading Economics’ own poll points to a much more optimistic R5.4bn surplus.
