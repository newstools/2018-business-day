Eskom, which is fighting for survival, has dragged its regulator to court over its tariff decision and is toughing it out against employees with a wage freeze, despite the growing prospect of a strike. At present it costs the company more to produce electricity than the National Energy Regulator of SA (Nersa) allows it to recoup from tariffs. The company also sits with a huge debt burden of R367bn, increasing by about R70bn a year. Eskom’s new management, headed by CEO Phakamani Hadebe, must cut costs, increase revenue and restructure debt if the company is to be sustainable into the future. But steps to do so — such as its wage freeze — have angered trade unions, which are set to embark on an illegal strike, with a meeting between unions to iron out details scheduled for Monday. Eskom workers are classified as essential services and cannot legally strike.
