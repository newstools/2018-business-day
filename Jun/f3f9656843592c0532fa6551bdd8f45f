The graft case against former president Jacob Zuma has been postponed to July 27 and will be moved to the High Court in Pietermaritzburg. Zuma's lawyer, Michael Hulley, told the court he should have more clarity on his client's funding issues by that court date. He would also still be lodging an application to review the National Director of Public Prosecution's decision to charge him, which was delayed because of lack of funding. The usual cast of character was in court to support the former president, and aÂ march to the court was planned. The issue of how Zuma's legal fees will be funded has been a major sticking point, with some commentators saying it could become a useful tactic in his "Stalingrad" defence. With staff writer
