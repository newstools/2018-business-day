Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi released two bills on Thursday that pave the way for sweeping reforms to the healthcare system. Both are likely to lead to heated debate with private sector providers over what is a fair rate for their services.

A crucial aspect of this plan will be the mechanism established to determine what the fund will pay hospitals, doctors and other healthcare professionals. "It is likely to be a difficult process to determine a fair price for both sides," said Insight Actuaries & Consultants joint CEO Barry Childs.
