Investors who lost billions of rand when Steinhoff International’s shares collapsed amid one of SA’s worst accounting scandals have very little chance of recouping their losses, according to one of the country’s largest fund managers.

In a letter to clients seen by Business Day, Kirshni Totaram, global head of institutional business at Coronation, said the company had sold its "remaining position in Steinhoff", prompted by an adjustment of the investment case to reflect additional information that had come to light since January.
