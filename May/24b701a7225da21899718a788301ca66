Viv Govender from Rand Swiss is in favour of coming in short on oil. He said that at $75 a barrel oil had hit a barrier. “Due to the issues in the Middle East (amongst some of them, US President Donald Trump mentioned he was going to blow up Iran). Keeping the price at $75 a barrel doesn’t look to be sustainable and it should be pulling back from here,” said Govender.
