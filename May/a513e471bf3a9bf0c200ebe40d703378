The JSE opened firmer on Monday in broad-based gains, with general retailers in the lead as the weaker rand boosted industrials and resources. The market has its eye on the Reserve Bankâ€™s interest-rate decision later this week, with no change expected. Global themes affecting the local market include rising US bond yields and higher oil prices, and uncertainty surrounding US trade talks with China. Naspers lifted 1% on positive Asian markets, as trade tension between China and the US eased. China has agreed to significantly increase its purchases of US goods and services, which should provide relief to investors, Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking analysts reported. The Dow closed flat on Friday. The Nikkei 225 was up 0.31% on a widening Japanese trade surplus for April. Exports surged 4.6% over the month, while imports declined by 1.2%, resulting in the surge in the surplus. Analysts said the rand was likely to remain under pressure until the dollar showed some signs of stabilising. The greenback has surged 2.35% against the euro in 2018, the best performance since 2016. The rand weakened to R12.895 to the dollar at the opening from R12.7755 earlier.
