North West premier Supra Mahumapelo has resigned from his position. Mahumapelo addressing journalists at the ANC’s headquarters in Johannesburg spent most of the time recounting the work the government in North West had done under his stewardship. This was despite the shambles the province was in and the allegations of corruption and maladministration under his watch. Mahumapelo avoided answering questions around this. The North West was recently embroiled in political turmoil, with riots and violent demonstrations against Mahumapelo, who initially refused to stand down as premier. The national government has since stepped in and the province has been put under administration. Last week, Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma announced that security cluster had stepped in to investigate allegations of corruption and maladministration against Mahumapelo and members of his executive. It was understood that allegations of corruption and maladministration were a key part of the presentations made to the ANC by various structures of the ANC-led alliance calling on Mahumapelo to step down. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule on Wednesday said Mahumapelo would remain in his position as ANC North West chairman, a position he was elected to, despite his resignation as premier. Mahumapelo’s replacement as premier will be decided by the ANC’s national executive committee (NEC), which will meet this weekend.
