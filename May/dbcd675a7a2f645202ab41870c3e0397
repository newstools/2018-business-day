The JSE opened marginally higher on Wednesday as miners and banks recovered from a weak previous session and the market awaited Chinese internet group Tencent’s quarterly results. Tencent’s numbers, expected after midday at the close of the Hang Seng, will have a direct effect on market heavyweight Naspers, which owns 31.2% of the giant Chinese company. Tencent and Naspers closed weaker on Tuesday, amid speculation that Tencent could report the lowest profit numbers in a decade. Naspers extended losses at the opening.
