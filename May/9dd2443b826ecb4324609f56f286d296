A bill that might pave the way for the government to seize land without compensation — which has been back and forth between the Presidency and Parliament for the past decade — has to be updated to bolster the principle, says an ANC transformation committee. This could set the stage for a replay of clashes in the ANC that could undermine President Cyril Ramaphosa and affect market sentiment.
