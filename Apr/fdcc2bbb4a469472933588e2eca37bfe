London — Rachael Blackmore will be one of three women jockeys vying to become the first female rider to win the greatest steeplechase, Grand National, on Saturday. Blackmore recently rode a winner for Alpha des Obeaux trainer Mouse Morris and the 2016 Grand National-winning handler is more than content to have her on board a horse he quietly fancies to win the historic race at Aintree racecourse. "Rachael has been lucky for us and she’s a very good pilot. We’re delighted to have her on board," said Morris. "He is a grade2 winner over fences and he’s going into the race fresh … he’s at his best when he’s fresh. Blackmore joins experienced compatriot Katie Walsh — whose third-place finish on Sea Bass in 2012 is the closest a woman jockey has come to winning the National — and top English rider Bryony Frost in the 40-runner field. Walsh rides Baie des Isles while Frost — daughter of 1989 Grand National-winning jockey Jimmy — is on Milansbar. All three are rated 33/1 chances. British bookmaker Ladbrokes offer 12/1 that one of the trio of women wins. AFP
