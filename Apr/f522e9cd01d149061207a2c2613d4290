The JSE opened higher on Monday on property stocks, as the market shrugged off the concern about an escalating global trade war. A resurgent Resilient, together with connected stocks in its stable, led property stocks higher while market heavyweight Naspers gained more than 1%. Resilient said shortly before markets closed on Friday that an independent audit of the group’s financials had been completed, and would ultimately be made public. The Dow Jones closed 2.34% lower at 23,932.76 points on Friday on disappointing jobs data and the raging trade war of words between the US and China. "Asian markets were mostly stronger this morning as White House officials down played President Donald Trump’s more aggressive stance on trade negotiations," analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking said. Trump administration officials on Sunday said that trade penalties were not imminent and there was ample time to work out a deal and step back from a possible trade war, Dow Jones Newswires reported. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said "he did not expect there would be a trade war" and that the US’s intention was to "continue to have discussions with China".
