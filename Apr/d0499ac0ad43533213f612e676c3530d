After a lull following the Easter break, the schedule of results from JSE-listed companies picks up again on Tuesday. Agricultural-focused holding company Zeder said on April 12 that it expected to report a return to profit for the year to end-February. Zeder said it expected to report headline earnings per share (HEPS) of between 24.4c  and 25.2c from the 2017 financial year’s 47.5c headline loss per share. "Headline earnings per share increased mainly due to the once-off management fee internalisation charge of R1.45bn to the income statement in the prior year," the trading statement said. Vehicle dealer chain Combined Motor Holdings (CMH) said on March 19 that it expected to report on Tuesday that its HEPS for the year to end-February grew by up to 20%. Basic earnings per share grew by up to 30%, the trading statement said without providing details for disparity with HEPS.
