Tokyo — Oil prices rose on Thursday, buoyed by the US government data showing a surprise drawdown in crude stockpiles and an easing of tension over a trade row between the US and China. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for May delivery was up 27c, or 0.4%, at $63.64 a barrel by 4.45am GMT after settling down 14c. Front-month London Brent crude for June delivery was up 30c, or 0.4%, at $68.32, having ended down 10c. Oil also got support from firm global equities, as the US expressed willingness to negotiate a resolution on trade after proposed US tariffs on $50bn in Chinese goods prompted a quick response from Beijing that it would retaliate by targeting key American imports. Oil prices have recently closely tracked equities. "The two countries are using discretion in their actions, and it does not look like the situation is developing into a full-scale trade war yet," said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo. "There is also hope for dialogue." Before the rebound late on Wednesday, after the release of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) inventory data, WTI and Brent had hit two-week lows after China proposed a broad range of tariffs on US exports, feeding the fear of a trade war. US crude inventories fell by 4.6-million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 246,000 barrels, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday. Oil has also received support after a Reuters survey showed on Wednesday that Opec oil output fell in March to an 11-month low due to declining Angolan exports, Libyan outages and a further slide in Venezuelan output. Shanghai crude futures trading was closed on Thursday due to a public holiday in China. Trading will resume on Monday. Reuters
