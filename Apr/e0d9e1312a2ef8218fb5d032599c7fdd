Mondi Ltd shares rose 3.8% to R333.43 and Mondi plc shares rose 3.7% to R334.88 on Friday morning, helping the JSE’s resources 10 index swim 2% higher against a red tide. "We are pleased to confirm that S&P has upgraded our credit rating in recognition of the group’s ongoing financial strength and robust business model," chief financial officer Andrew King said in a media release on Thursday.
