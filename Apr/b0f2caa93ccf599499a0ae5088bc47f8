The JSE was flat at the opening on Monday morning on a sharply weaker rand following a sharp spike in US bond yields. Steinhoff and shares in the Resilient stable were under renewed selling pressure, while British American Tobacco recovered following Philip Morris’s market scare last week. The US 10-year yield rose to just below 3% on inflationary concerns as oil prices reached new highs last week. The dollar firmed in overnight trade before stabilising, sending the rand to its weakest level in three months. The rand weakened to R12.2684 to the dollar before recovering marginally. The US 10-year was last seen at 2.9775% from 2.9607%. Geopolitics and an uptick in global equities has helped crude push to three-and-a-half-year highs, Dow Jones Newswires reported.
