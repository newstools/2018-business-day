The Dow opened strongly on Monday on a conciliatory tweet from President Donald Trump about trade relations with China. However, the rally turned sour amid news that the FBI raided the offices of his personal attorney Michael Cohen in New York, which Trump called a "disgrace".

Chinese internet company Tencent gained 1.8% in Hong Kong trade, supporting a comeback by Naspers on the JSE, which owns 31.2% of Tencent.

"This brings the total number of Brics countries in the US’s cross hairs to two — Russia and China — which can only further uncertainty and subsequent emerging market weakness," TreasuryOne analyst Andre Botha said.
