Ascendis Health on Thursday reported a 27% increase in revenue to R4bn for the six months to end-December, driven by the strong performance of the group’s international operations, which grew revenue by 50% to R1.9bn.

Wellner spoke to Business Day TV about the results. OR LISTEN TO THE AUDIO: Listen to all latest podcasts here.
