South African government bonds were marginally weaker shortly before midday on Thursday, with markets cautious, amid looming risk events. "Investors appear to be waiting for some form of a catalyst to trade on‚ but aside from the Moody’s decision … next week Friday‚ there is very little else on the horizon‚" said TreasuryOne head of dealing Wichard Cilliers. Globally, markets were eyeing a reshuffle of White House officials, with Larry Kudlow accepting the role of US President Donald Trump’s chief economic advisor. Kudlow said that the US would take a harder line on intellectual property theft in China. The rand, and bonds, were largely unaffected by the trade-war risks, and were only likely to move significantly next week, said Rand Merchant Bank bond analyst Gordon Kerr. Next week sees the conclusion of a US Federal Reserve open market committee meeting, and an expected announcement on SA’s credit status by ratings agency Moody’s. At 11.30am, the R186 was bid at 8.100% from 8.075% and the R207 at 6.705% from 6.685%. The rand was at R11.7923 to the dollar from R11.7736.
