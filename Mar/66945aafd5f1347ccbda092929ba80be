Trade union Hospersa said on Friday it was shocked by reports that patients’ medical files at Charlotte Maxeke Academic hospital were stored in a room drenched with water due to a burst pipe. Reports of the flooding came close to a year after the hospital’s roof caved in‚ trapping five people under the rubble. The union called on the chief inspector of the Department of Labour to act firmly against institutions found to be violating occupational health and safety (OHS) policies. On Friday morning‚ news broke that patients’ medical files at one of Johannesburg’s busiest hospitals‚ were being stored in the room with leaking pipes. The union said a video of "what looks like a medical records room" was shared on social media by a news agency and caused a stir as piles of files were seen lying in a pool of water caused by a dripping pipe burst. "Based on the video‚ we are concerned about the poor state of which patients files are being kept‚" said Hospersa manager dealing with OHS‚ Fazeela Fayers. "We also wonder if there is a back-up system in place to ensure patients’ personal information is not lost as a result of this burst pipe. We are equally concerned about our members’ safety at this hospital‚ seeing that incidents like this seem to be a frequent occurrence due to the faulty pipe system in place‚" she added. "The problem of OHS violations in the health sector is extreme — it is a national problem‚ and there are daily compromises to the safety of the workforce‚ patients and the public‚" said Fayers. "Dilapidated buildings with burst water pipes and collapsed ceilings have become the face of public health facilities. The working conditions of our members in the delivery of healthcare service is deplorable and this must be addressed urgently‚" she said.
