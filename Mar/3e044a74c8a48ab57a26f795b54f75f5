The JSE opened weaker on Friday, as a slew of results failed to lift sentiment. Global equity markets were sharply lower, despite upbeat US economic data. The latest data from the US regarding jobs and income exceeded expectations, FxPro analysts said. These include weekly initial unemployment claims in the US, which fell to 210,000, more than a 40-year low. Markets have also been affected by solid data regarding personal income in the US, FxPro said, after US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday that there were little signs of the US economy overheating. The Dow closed 1.68% lower at 24,608.98 points on Thursday, while the Nikkei 225 dropped 2.5%. The Hang Seng was 1.51% lower. "The Dow fell for the third straight day after President Donald Trump said the US would impose import tariffs on steel and aluminium, raising concerns about a potential trade war," analysts at Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking said. US vehicle makers and other large steel consumers came under pressure, with the likes of General Motors and Ford losing 4% and 3% respectively, while US Steel rallied 5.7%.
