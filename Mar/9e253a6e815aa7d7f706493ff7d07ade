The Constitutional Court has extended the South African Social Security Agency’s (Sassa) contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) for another six months. Sassa was also granted direct access to bring the application; it had argued that the extension was needed to cater for cash payments of social grants to 2.5-million beneficiaries. However, when reading out the judgment, Justice Leona Theron said, “It is declared that for the period of six months from April 1 2018, Sassa and CPS are under a constitutional obligation to ensure payment of social grants to beneficiaries who are paid in cash.” “The declaration of invalidity of the contract between Sassa and CPS in relation to payments of social grants to beneficiaries who are paid in cash is further suspended for a six month period.” The South African Post Office (Sapo) will take over the payment of social grants once the CPS contract ends, but has said it needs time to phase in services to take over the payments.
