The JSE opened flat on Monday, as platinum shares rallied on a higher metal price and annual results from Anglo American Platinum (Amplats), with property stocks remaining under pressure. The property index lost 1% last week as the all share delivered its best weekly performance this year, gaining 5.76%. Resilient dropped another 4% on Monday morning, despite some individual property shares faring well. Resilient said on Friday that it had initiated an independent review into the cross-shareholding structure of the group, Miners found some support from a weaker rand, but banks and retailers trended lower. Market sentiment was subdued on some profit-taking after President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s state of the nation address on Friday, following the sharp rises earlier in the week. "The speech was well-received, with the core focus being creating jobs, clamping down on corruption and reforming state-owned enterprises," Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) analysts said. The rather leftist rhetoric taken by the ANC recently came across fairly muted, which was positive, Nedbank said. The Dow ended an upbeat week on Friday by closing flat.
