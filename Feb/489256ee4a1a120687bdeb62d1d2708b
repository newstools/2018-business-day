CAPE TOWN - The investigation into the sale of 10-million barrels of SA's strategic fuel reserves by the Strategic Fuel Fund (SFF) was not satisfactory, Energy Minister David Mahlobo said on Tuesday, pointing a finger at an international law firm contracted for the probe. He told members of Parliament's portfolio committee on energy that a new investigation had been launched. He wanted this to be concluded as a matter of urgency though could not give a time-frame for this. Mahlobo said it was very disappointing that Allen Over, the international legal firm, had done a shoddy job and had not interviewed all those involved. The firm had issued a disclaimer of its report which Mahlobo said was produced after two years. Responding to the minister's comments Allen Overy said: “The firm conducted the report fully within the terms of reference set by the then minister, which were to conduct a desktop contract review only, and which neither instructed nor authorized the interviewing of SFF employees involved in the matter." The law firm added: "There was no conflict of interest in the production of the report, which the firm stands by. However the firm has declined to be involved in a separate and more recent matter due to a potential conflict of interest.” Allen Overy also sought to correct Mahlobo's version that it took two years to produce the report saying its appointment letter was dated October 26, 2016 while its report was delivered on  December 20 of the same year. Mahlobo said he had been informed that the conflict of interest related to the relationship which the legal firm had with the international trader that bought the oil from the SFF. This was unethical, he added. The minister said government would have to investigate recovering the money spent on the investigation.
