The results for the Assessment of Professional Competence (APC), the second and final South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (Saica) board exam were released on Friday. KPMG said this week it was proud to contribute a further 311 candidates to the chartered accountancy profession in SA. These candidates, of whom 179 are black, have cleared the final academic hurdle to qualify as chartered accountants, or CA(SA)s. “We are especially proud of our candidates on Saica’s honours roll,” KPMG said. “Saica uses the honours roll to recognise those candidates who performed exceptionally well and showed the greatest insight into the way in which they completed the case-study tasks.” Did you know?
