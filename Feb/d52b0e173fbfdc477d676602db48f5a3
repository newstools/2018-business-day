For the school year under way, Curro said it had grown its total learner numbers by 14% to 52,233. "We are satisfied with the 14% growth in learner numbers in 2018, considering that 5% of 2017 learners did not enrol in 2018, mainly due to affordability reasons," CEO Andries Greyling said in the results statement. "In its 20th year of existence, Curro has passed another milestone with more than 50,000 learners across 59 campuses with 138 schools," Greyling said. Curro’s overall revenue grew 22% to R2.1bn in the year to end-December from 2016’s revenue which was restated to R1.72bn from R1.76bn to account for the separation of Stadio.
