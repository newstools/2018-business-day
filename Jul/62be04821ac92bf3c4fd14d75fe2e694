Jacob Zuma's "worst nightmare" will come true early this week when his son Duduzane is charged over his alleged involvement in the Gupta plot to bribe former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas. The 34-year-old "has been asked to surrender himself to face charges" at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Johannesburg, said his lawyer, Rudi Krause. Krause said he had assured the Hawks that Duduzane would present himself at court, and it would not be necessary to arrest him. The date and time for his appearance will be agreed today.
