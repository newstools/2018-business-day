Liston Meintjes from Nvest Securities chose Intu Properties as his stock pick of the day. Intu owns 10 of the top 25 shopping malls in the UK.

They have tenants who signed long-term leases and, looking at their rental numbers, they are not negative.” OR LISTEN TO THE AUDIO: Listen to all latest podcasts here
