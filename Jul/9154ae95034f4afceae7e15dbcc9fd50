Kyle Burgess from Nedbank Private Wealth chose EOH Holdings as his stock pick of the day. The share was trading close to R30 and had a forward price-earning ratio of four, he said. There was also “some good news in the media, with ENS releasing a report stating that there was no foul play on any of the deals that [EOH] have done.… [This] does make EOH a good stock pick for the day.”
