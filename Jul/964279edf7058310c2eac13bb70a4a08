Graeme Franck from PSG Wealth chose Anglo American as his stock pick of the day, both on spot commodity prices and on forward earnings as it is trading on a price-earnings ratio in single digits around nine. The company’s dividend yield is at about 4.5%-5%. “Anglo American is definitely repairing their balance sheet at a quick pace,” he said.
