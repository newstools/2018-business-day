The JSE was weaker on Tuesday morning, as global markets treaded cautiously ahead of risk events, even though local news was slightly more positive. The rand and bonds are expected to be range-bound on Tuesday, as markets seek fresh catalysts from either the Reserve Bank or inflation data later in the week. On Tuesday morning, rand was steady at about R13.20 to the dollar, having recently reached a one-month high against the dollar. Global releases this week, however, have reinforced the perception that emerging markets will remain under some pressure. On Monday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) kept its growth forecast for the global economy at 3.9% for 2018, but noted that growth had become more uneven. Added to this was the Chinese forecast, which some analysts said pointed to signs that that economy was cooling. Naspers was down 2%, tracking losses by Hong Kong listed associate Tencent, of which it holds a sizable share. Locally on Tuesday, the FNB/BER consumer confidence index moderated slightly to 22 index points in the second quarter, but remained high.
