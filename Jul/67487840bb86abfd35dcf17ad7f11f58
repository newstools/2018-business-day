Global Asset Management issued a trading statement on Monday saying it expected to report on Tuesday that interim headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months to end-May would be about the same as in the matching period. But basic earnings per share (EPS) would be only about a third of the matching period’s 8.4c. "The decline in the EPS is mainly due to the prior period recording a once off gain of R3.8m due to a change in control of a subsidiary, with the core operations showing an improvement from the prior comparative period," the trading statement said.
