Former president Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane was granted bail of R100,000 in the Specialised Commercial Crimes court on Monday. He is expected back in court on January 24 2019 and was ordered to hand in his passport to the investigating officer. One of his bail conditions is that he must report to the Rosebank police station every Tuesday. Duduzane Zuma has been formally charged with corruption and faces an alternative charge of conspiracy to commit corruption. The charge relates to his involvement in an alleged Gupta family plot to bribe former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas. Before his court appearance, Duduzane Zuma arrived at the police station just after 7am on Monday morning‚ and greeted journalists as he walked inside. “Hello‚” he said‚ “are you well?” He will appear at the Randburg magistrate's court later this week‚ to face two charges of culpable homicide. He arrived back in SA from abroad last week to attend the weekend funeral of his younger brother‚ Vusi. He was briefly detained at the airport and questioned over a 2016 matter — believed to be the alleged R600m bribe offered to former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas by the Gupta family to take over as finance minister in 2015. Duduzane Zuma was allegedly in the room at the time of the offer. Jonas alleged in a sworn affidavit to former public protector Thuli Madonsela that he had been offered a bribe of R600m to accept the assignment. Jonas said Duduzane had organised the meeting and introduced him to the Guptas at their residence in Saxonwold, Johannesburg.
