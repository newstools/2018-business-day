Markets are currently digesting the Chinese reaction to $34bn in tariffs imposed by the US on Friday morning, even as the US and EU make moves to reduce tension in their trading relationship.

The dollar had come under some pressure overnight, after US Federal Reserve minutes from its June meeting signalled that policy makers could raise rates over the next 12 months to a level that no longer aimed to stimulate the economy.
