McKinsey, the global consultancy that had to refund Eskom almost R1bn in fees, will continue to pursue state-sector work in SA using the same controversial pricing model that landed it in hot water. The firm and its local Gupta-linked partner, Trillian, were paid R1.6bn from a 2016 contract that was invalid as it had not been approved by Treasury.

McKinsey reached an agreement with Eskom and the asset forfeiture unit on Friday on returning the fees, but has denied any criminal wrongdoing.
