Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has bemoaned red tape and a ministerial revolving door that make it difficult to push through policy changes. Gigaba, who himself has been public enterprises minister, home affairs minister and finance minister, before moving back to the home affairs portfolio, told a Black Business Council (BBC) roundtable in Sandton on Friday: "The biggest problem the ANC needs to address is that a vision can’t be carried by an individual but needs to be carried by an institution. The vision must be sustainable even if the individuals aren’t sustainable." In references to the various cabinet reshuffles in the past few years, he said: "We don’t even know whether we’re still going to be here to carry out these visions." While the Department of Home Affairs had ambitious plans to make the department completely paperless, to review critical skills work permits and to manage SA’s borders, it was difficult to make changes, he said. "The immigration act couldn’t deal with a number of challenges, we need a new policy framework," he said. "Red tape makes it difficult for decisions to move speedily. To get something approved takes over a year. Things that need to move quickly, take forever."
