The ANC wants greater private investment in struggling state-owned power utility Eskom, treasurer-general Paul Mashatile said on Thursday. Mashatile said the party was holding discussions about splitting up Eskom’s operations. He was speaking during a business breakfast on the sideline of a Brics summit in Johannesburg. Cash-strapped Eskom reported a R2.3bn loss for the financial year to end-March. Mashatile also said SA could not, for now, afford massive nuclear expansion, and SA’s strategy on nuclear energy should be to avoid a "big bang approach".
