Springboks and Sharks winger S’busiso Nkosi may be waylaid by injury but nevertheless feels his provincial team have a huge Currie Cup score to settle. The Sharks dominated 2017’s double-round competition but lost steam at a critical part of the tournament. After winning 10 of their 12 league matches, the Sharks slipped up against Western Province in their final round-robin game. While they managed to get past the Bulls in the semifinals‚ they showed big-match jitters that came to bear in the final. They lost the home final 33-21 to the same Western Province side that beat them in the league stage. What made the loss galling was that the Sharks held a 21-15 halftime lead. "Losing the Currie Cup final counts as motivation and we’ve got a bigger point to prove now since we lost at home. "We’re going to try to get another home final and bring the cup home‚" Nkosi said. "We had a great campaign last year and if we can take what we did last year and add a bit more big-match temperament when it comes to the play-offs‚ we’ll be good contenders to win the tournament." Nkosi‚ who said he was four to six weeks away from recovering from an ankle injury‚ also said Mahlatse "Chiliboy" Ralepelle was a good choice as captain for the campaign. The Sharks have 10 players in the Springbok squad, with hooker Akker van der Merwe making it ahead of Ralepelle. In a tournament often seen as a developmental one‚ experienced players such as Ralepelle are not often around to lend a seasoned hand. TimesLIVE
