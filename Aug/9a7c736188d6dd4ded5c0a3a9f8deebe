Imperial is offering to repurchase its preference shares for R85.53 each, a 23% premium to Fridayâ€™s closing price of R69.50. In addition, Imperial preference shareholders will receive a R4.17 dividend on October 1 for the six months to end-June. The offer price values the preference shares at R83, with an accrued dividend of R2.53 since June, Imperial said in a statement on Monday. Imperial said it is redeeming its preference shares as a way to simplify its capital structure ahead of its plan to unbundle its vehicle trading division into and independently listed company, Motus. Redeeming the preference shares will result in a one-off accounting profit of R64m as they were treated as a financial liability for accounting purposes. Transaction costs are expected to be R2m, Imperial said.
