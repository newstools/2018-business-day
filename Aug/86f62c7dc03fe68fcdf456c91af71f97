Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor detailed how she came to meet the Gupta brothers and how the controversial family facilitated a meeting between her and former president Jacob Zuma. Mentor was testifying at the commission of inquiry into state capture. In 2016, after revelations about how the Guptas had offered former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas a Cabinet position, Mentor alleged that she was also offered a position by the brothers. This allegedly happened in 2010 and she was offered the position of minister of public enterprises. Mentor told the commission on Monday that she was first introduced to one of the Guptas, Rajesh, by Zuma's son Duduzane. The introduction was made aboard a plane while she was travelling to China as part of a delegation for Zuma's state visit. Rajesh Gupta told her that his brother Atul was part of an advanced team in the presidency sent ahead to China to deal with logistics. Mentor said that while in China, the two Gupta brothers arrived at her hotel, ahead of a state banquet, requesting that she go with them to meet Zuma. However, Mentor said she refused to go. "I was not, as a woman, going to go to President Zuma, who had then had a reputation with women," she told the commission. Mentor said that after her conversation over the hotel telephone with one of the Gupta brothers, she felt unsafe and started to make arrangements to leave China early. Almost two weeks after the China trip, on a Sunday, she received a call from Lakela Kaunda, Zuma's chief of staff on a Sunday, arranging a meeting with the president the next day in Johannesburg, she said. Mentor said Lakela told her Atul Gupta would call her to make arrangements. The hearings continue.
