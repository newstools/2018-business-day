Caroline Cremen from AdviceWorx chose Shoprite as her stock pick of the day. The share has been oversold, "it’s a quality business, with great corporate governance and great logistics and you rarely get to buy this into a downward trend and, if you want this company, you should take advantage of their current price", she says.
