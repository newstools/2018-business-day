The JSE opened weaker on Thursday in renewed risk-off trade amid new signs of an escalating global trade war with China as the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, as expected. Naspers was one of the early losers, dropping 2.45% to R3,189.15 soon after the opening. It ended July 7% weaker. President Donald Trump has told US officials to consider raising proposed tariffs on $200bn in Chinese goods to 25%. Asian markets were weaker in response, with the Hang Seng losing more than 2%. The Nikkei 225 shed 1.03%. The Dow closed 0.32% lower on Wednesday, with US stocks closing mostly lower after the Fed’s decision. Fresh worries over US-China trade friction dampened sentiment, although positive results from Apple buoyed the tech sector and helped the Nasdaq to buck the weakening trend, Dow Jones Newswires reported. The Fed offered an upbeat assessment of the US economy’s performance, suggesting another interest-rate increase is likely at its next meeting. The Fed repeatedly emphasised the economy’s strength in a statement released after its two-day policy meeting. It offered nothing to dispel market expectations that it would deliver its third interest-rate increase of the year when it meets in late September, the newswires reported.
