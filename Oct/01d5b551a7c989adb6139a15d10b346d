How much will it cost to close down SAA? Is it R11bn, R47bn or R60bn? The DA has taken issue with the claim by deputy finance minister Mondli Gungubele that it would cost R60bn to close SAA. Gungubele made the comments in parliament six months ago to justify further bailouts for the airline. He said the R60bn would be three times the funding — R21.7bn — SAA has asked from the Treasury for a turnaround plan over three years.
