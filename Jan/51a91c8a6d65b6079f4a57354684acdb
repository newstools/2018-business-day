The extent of the financial distress within Lonmin, a major platinum group metal producer, was highlighted in delayed results released on Monday. The results showed a heady plunge into a deep loss and a breach of temporarily suspended debt covenant conditions. The results were the clearest demonstration yet of why Lonmin is a takeover target by gold and platinum miner Sibanye-Stillwater. Lonminâ€™s lenders have agreed to waiver their covenant conditions until February 2019, the latest date by which the assets should have a new owner. The price of the waiver was an immediate freeze on further debt provision and loan facilities to Lonmin. Lonmin reported an annual post-tax loss for the year to end-September of $1.15bn, compared with a $400m loss the year before. The company recorded a $1.05bn impairment of nonfinancial assets during the year, almost equivalent to the tangible net worth value of $1.1bn it was not allowed to go below in terms of its covenants. Lonmin would have to pay $150m if it breached the covenants. It had $235m of cash and cash equivalents at the end of a year in which it had negative cash flow of $67m, compared with an outflow of $31m the year before. The company reported revenue of $1.17bn compared with $1.12bn revenue the year before. Platinum group metal sales fell to 1.38-million ounces from 1.41-million ounces the year before.
