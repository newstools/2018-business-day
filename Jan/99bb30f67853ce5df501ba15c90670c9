Eskom finally released its delayed interim results on Tuesday, demonstrating that credit lines were again open to the company. However, auditors indicated that some concerns remained about its ability to meet all its financial obligations over the next 12-18 months. The company came dangerously close to having its bonds suspended by the JSE and to defaulting on debt and other obligations, and it would have had it not been able to secure assurances from banks in the past week that it would be funded to the tune of R20bn over the next 30 days. An Eskom default would have been catastrophic for the economy as it would have triggered cross defaults of all government debt. Interim CEO Phakamani Hadebe said at a briefing on Tuesday that while the money was not yet “in the bank”, Eskom had secured commitments of R10bn by February 1 and another R10bn by the end of February. This enabled the release of the financial statements for the six months to the end of September. However, auditors issued an unqualified review but with an “emphasis of matter” on its ability to continue as a going concern for the next year to 18 months. Eskom’s liquid assets dwindled to R9bn at the end of September from R30bn the year before, as a result of flat revenue caused by falling sales and lower-than-anticipated tariff increases New chairperson Jabu Mabuza and Hadebe said that the overriding problem at Eskom — apart from governance, on which both the government and board were now acting — was the company’s R360bn debt burden. At the end of September, its gearing ratio (debt to equity) had risen to 72%. Mabuza said that Eskom’s debt levels were simply “unsustainable” and that a more reasonable target to achieve would be a 50% gearing ratio.
