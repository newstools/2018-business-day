The rand stabilised at about R14.53/$ Monday morning after weakening to R14.70/$ over the weekend, a level last seen in October.

The JSE opened higher, though, as the weaker rand environment supported big rand-hedge stocks such Anglo Gold Ashanti. But trading volumes were expected to be low due to due a shortened session ahead of the Christmas break.
