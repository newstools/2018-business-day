Caroline Cremen from Adviceworx chose Growthpoint as her stock pick of the day. She has taken a conservative approach in this volatile market. “The property stock yields are amazing at 8%-9% plus. The best managed property company on the JSE is Growthpoint, it’s a very diverse, very well managed company that has international arm in Australia. With its yield being this high, it’s better to have an investment in a stock where the yield can go up.”
