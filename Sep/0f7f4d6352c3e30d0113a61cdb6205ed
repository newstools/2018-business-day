Nesan Nair from Sasfin Securities chose British American Tobacco (BTI) as his stock pick of the day. Nair says that in the current market climate, one should remain fairly rand-hedged. British American Tobacco had a torrent time earlier in 2018 and should still produce good dividends and good long term growth, Nair said.
