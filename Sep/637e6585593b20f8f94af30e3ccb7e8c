The JSE opened flat on Tuesday on a recovery in Naspers and amid cautious trade ahead of the release of local GDP numbers later in the morning. The consensus view is for growth of 0.5% in the second quarter. The economy would then escape an official recession following the first quarter’s retraction of 2.2%. However, much depends on the volatile agricultural sector, with disappointing numbers from the sector increasing the likelihood of disappointing data. "The agricultural sector is expected to have contracted substantially compared to the first quarter, while published trade data for the second quarter also point to another quarterly decline," said Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop. However, she said the country may avoid a technical recession by a fine margin.
