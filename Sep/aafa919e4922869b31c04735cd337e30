Northam Platinum and Sygnia joined MTN in appointing former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas an independent nonexecutive director. On Monday, Northam issued a statement saying Jonas, along with former Aquarius Platinum CEO Jean Nel, would be joining its board. Sygnia also announced later that it would ask its shareholders to approve Jonas's appointment as a nonexecutive director with effect from September 1. Sygnia invited its shareholders to vote for the appointment of Jonas, along with former Deutsche Bank global head of equity trading Andre Crawford-Brunt and former Alexander Forbes head of consulting David Hufton, at an AGM on October 2. On May 7, MTN appointed Jonas along with Swazi Tshabalala as nonexecutive directors. Jonas, a key whistle-blower who helped expose SA’s state capture scandal, has been in the news recently, testifying before the Zondo commission. Besides serving on Northam and MTN’s boards as an independent nonexecutive director, Jonas is one of four independent presidential investment envoys appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa to attract investors to SA. He is also a former chair and nonexecutive director of the Public Investment Corporation. laingr@businesslive.co.za
