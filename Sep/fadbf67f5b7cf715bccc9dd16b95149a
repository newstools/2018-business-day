The JSE all share opened weaker on Monday on what is expected to be a subdued trading day, with US markets closed for a public holiday. The Dow closed 0.09% off on Friday. Asian markets started the week in the red, with the Nikkei 225 dropping 0.69% and the Hang Seng 0.79%. Volumes were below R1bn about 30 minutes after the opening, lower than average trade volume at the time. Naspers took the lead among the losers, dropping 1.84% to R3,205.63 amid ongoing concern about a further crackdown by Chinese authorities on gaming in the country. Chinese internet company Tencent, of which Naspers owns about a third, has been hit hard by these steps as it is the biggest games-downloading company in the country. It was down nearly 3% in Hong Kong trade. Naspers lost 7.7% last week. Rand hedges were also lower in risk-off trade, despite the weaker rand. Expectations are that the rand could lose further ground in the week amid indications that US President Donald Trump will implement further tariff hikes against $200bn of Chinese goods this week. "The upcoming week could be another tough one for the rand," said FXTM analyst Jameel Ahmad. Investors remain concerned about the developments in Argentina and Turkey. "Traders have turned negative toward currencies in countries with high current account deficits," he said.
